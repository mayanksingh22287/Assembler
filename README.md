# COPROJECT
This is our CO_project The assembler.py file contains the code for assembler only... 
The Results_after_automatedTesting.zip contains screenshots of successfull resulted testing of assembler code....
Code is contributed by : Abhay Dagar (2022014) Krishnendu (2022255) Mayank Kumar (2022284) Mayank Singh (2022287)....
In Bonus Part We have added The following Operations:
(i) andi: Reg  Imm  opcode:10011 (It performs Bitwise AND operation between Register and Imm)
(ii) jz : Reg  mem_add opcode:10101 (It go to the memory address if Reg=0)
(iii) Ldi : Reg Imm  opcode:10110 (It loads imm value in Reg)
(iv) mulf : Reg1 Reg2 Reg3 opecode:10111 (It multiplies the reg2 and reg3 and store the value in reg1 in float form)
(v) nandi : Reg1 Imm opcode:10100  (It performs Bitwise Nand operation between Register and Imm)
